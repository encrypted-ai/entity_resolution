LangGraph Workflow Management for Entity Resolution
==================================================

This module provides specialized classes for creating and managing LangGraph 
computational workflows for entity resolution tasks. It separates the graph 
orchestration logic from the core column matching functionality, providing 
better modularity and extensibility for complex entity resolution pipelines.

Classes:
    LangGraphWorkflow: Main workflow orchestrator for entity resolution tasks

Dependencies:
    - langchain.graphs: For creating computational workflow graphs
    - SimilarColumnFinder: Core entity resolution functionality (from entity_resolution.py)

    """
    A specialized class for creating and managing LangGraph computational workflows 
    for entity resolution tasks. This class separates the graph orchestration logic 
    from the core column matching functionality, providing better modularity and 
    extensibility for complex entity resolution pipelines.
    
    Purpose & Design Philosophy:
    ---------------------------
    This class follows the Single Responsibility Principle by focusing exclusively 
    on workflow orchestration and graph management, while delegating the actual 
    entity resolution logic to the SimilarColumnFinder class. This separation 
    provides several key benefits:
    
    1. MODULARITY: Graph creation logic is isolated from column matching logic
    2. REUSABILITY: The workflow can be easily adapted for different entity resolution tasks
    3. TESTABILITY: Graph construction can be tested independently of matching algorithms
    4. EXTENSIBILITY: New workflow patterns can be added without modifying core logic
    5. MAINTAINABILITY: Changes to graph structure don't affect matching algorithms
    
    Workflow Patterns Supported:
    ---------------------------
    - Parallel column description generation for multiple datasets
    - Sequential dependency management (descriptions â†’ matching)
    - Fan-out/fan-in patterns for scalable processing
    - Future support for complex multi-stage entity resolution pipelines
    
    Args:
        column_finder (SimilarColumnFinder): An instance of the SimilarColumnFinder 
                                           class that provides the actual entity 
                                           resolution functionality. This composition 
                                           pattern allows the workflow to leverage 
                                           existing matching capabilities while 
                                           maintaining separation of concerns.
    
    Example Usage:
        # Initialize the core entity resolution functionality
        from entity_resolution import SimilarColumnFinder
        finder = SimilarColumnFinder()
        
        # Create the workflow orchestrator
        workflow = LangGraphWorkflow(finder)
        
        # Create and execute a graph for specific datasets
        graph = workflow.create_column_matching_graph(df1, df2)

        between orchestration and implementation concerns.
        
        Args:
            column_finder (SimilarColumnFinder): The entity resolution engine

                                               and matching capabilities.

        Creates a LangGraph computational workflow that visualizes and orchestrates 
        the complete entity resolution column matching pipeline as a directed acyclic 
        graph (DAG) of operations.
        
        Purpose in Entity Resolution:
        ----------------------------
        This method serves multiple critical purposes in the entity resolution workflow:
        
        1. WORKFLOW VISUALIZATION: Provides a clear visual representation of how 
           the column matching process flows from raw data to final matches
           
        2. PARALLEL EXECUTION: Enables independent column description tasks for 
           both datasets to run in parallel, significantly improving performance
           
        3. DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT: Ensures the comparison step only executes after 
           both description steps are complete, maintaining data consistency
           
        4. DEBUGGING & MONITORING: Allows users to inspect intermediate results 
           at each stage, helping identify issues in the matching pipeline
           
        5. EXTENSIBILITY: Provides a framework for adding additional processing 
           steps (e.g., data validation, statistical analysis, quality checks)
        
        Graph Structure & Entity Resolution Flow:
        ----------------------------------------
        The graph implements a classic "fan-out, fan-in" pattern optimal for 
        entity resolution tasks:
        
        +---------------------+    +---------------------+
        | Describe Dataset 1  |    | Describe Dataset 2  |
        | Columns (Parallel)  |    | Columns (Parallel)  |
        +----------+----------+    +----------+----------+
                   |                          |
                   +---------+----------------+
                            |
                  +---------v----------+
                  |  Compare & Match   |
                  |    Columns         |
                  | (Fuzzy Matching)   |
                  +---------+----------+
                            |
                  +---------v----------+
                  | Consolidate Data   |
                  | (Join if avg match |
                  |  >0.7, else concat)|
                  +--------------------+
        
        Why This Architecture Benefits Entity Resolution:
        -----------------------------------------------
        - PARALLELISM: Column descriptions for both datasets can be generated 
          simultaneously, reducing total processing time by ~50%
          
        - SCALABILITY: Each node can be independently optimized or scaled based 
          on dataset size and complexity
          
        - FAULT TOLERANCE: If one description task fails, the other can still 
          complete, allowing partial results and easier debugging
          
        - REPRODUCIBILITY: The graph structure ensures consistent execution 
          order across multiple runs
          
        - INTELLIGENT CONSOLIDATION: Automatically decides whether to join or
          concatenate datasets based on column match quality (threshold 0.7)
        
        Args:
            df1 (pd.DataFrame): First dataset whose columns will be described 
                              in parallel with df2's columns
            df2 (pd.DataFrame): Second dataset whose columns will be described 
                              in parallel with df1's columns

        Returns:
            NodeGraph: A LangGraph object representing the complete entity resolution 
                      workflow. The graph contains four nodes:
                      - 'Describe Dataset 1': Generates semantic descriptions for df1 columns
                      - 'Describe Dataset 2': Generates semantic descriptions for df2 columns  
                      - 'Compare & Match': Performs fuzzy matching on the descriptions
                      - 'Consolidate Data': Joins datasets if avg match >0.7, else concatenates
                      
                      The graph can be executed to run the full pipeline or visualized 
                      to understand the workflow structure.
                      
        Raises:
            TypeError: If df1 or df2 are not pandas DataFrames
            ValueError: If df1 or df2 are empty
        
        Usage Example:
            # Create and execute the workflow graph
            workflow = LangGraphWorkflow(finder)
            graph = workflow.create_column_matching_graph(df1, df2)
            results = graph.run()  # Execute the full pipeline
            
            # Or visualize the workflow
            graph.visualize()  # Shows the DAG structure
            
        Note: This method provides an alternative to calling find_similar_columns() 
              directly, offering more visibility and control over the execution process.
